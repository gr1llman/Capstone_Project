Pro-USA bias in yelp.com reviews?
========================================================
- Generally assumed that people believe country they live in to be superior to other countries
- Particularily assumed to be true of Americans
- Should be demonstrable through comparison of star ratings (1-5 scale) in yelp.com reviews based on business and reviewer location
- Analysis of 1.6M reviews spanning 61K businesses in four (4) countries
- Understanding bias in yelp.com reviews should make reviews more comparable and usable
- Could provide evidence for or against USA bias.
```{r chunk1, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# This code chunk ensures working directory is set correctly, loads required 
# libraries and then reads in the data set formatted for examination.  
# The data loaded is a combination of the business and the review files.
### Set working directory

setwd("~/Data Science - Capstone Project")

### Load required libraries

library(knitr)
library(plyr)
### library(jsonlite)
library(reshape)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(lattice)

###  Load the reviews (combined) data frame from a file
load("reviews.RDA")
```

The data from yelp.com
========================================================
```{r plot1, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

###  What does the data look like?
###

###
###  Set up 2 up
###

### par(mfrow=c(1,2))
par(mar=c(4,4,4,4))
par(cex.axis = 0.9)
### par(cex.main = 1)
### par(cex.lab = 0.8)

### Horizontal Barplot showing distribution of reviews by country

temp <- count(reviews, c("country"))
temp <- temp[order(temp$freq), ]
barplot(temp$freq / 1000,
        names.arg = temp$country,
        xlab = "Reviews (,000s)",
        col = c("yellow", "orange","red","blue"),
        horiz = TRUE,
        xlim = c(0, 1800),
        las = 1,
        main = "All Sample Reviews by Country Where Business Resides")
j <- .8
for (i in 1:dim(temp)[1]) {
        tt <- as.character(format(temp[i,]$freq / 1000, digits = .1))
        text(temp[i, ]$freq /1000 + 110, j, tt)
        j <- j + 1.2
}

### Barplot showing distribution of all reviews

temp <- count(reviews$review_stars)
barplot(temp$freq / 1000,
        names.arg = temp$x,
       xlab = "Stars", 
       ylab = "Reviews (,000s)",
       col = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "greenyellow", "darkgreen"),
       ylim = c(0,700),
       main = "All Sample Reviews by Stars Awarded")

j <- .8
for (i in 1:dim(temp)[1]) {
        tt <- as.character(format(temp[i,]$freq / 1000, digits = .1))
        text(j,temp[i, ]$freq /1000 + 70, tt)
        j <- j + 1.2
}

abline(v = mean(reviews$review_stars), col = "blue", lwd = 2)
tt <- as.character(format(mean(reviews$review_stars), digits = .1, nsmall = 2))
tt <- paste("Mean: ", tt)
text(mean(reviews$review_stars) - 1, 650, tt, col = "blue")
```
 
Approach
========================================================
1. Analyze the entire collective population
    - Focus on stars assigned and location of businesses
    - Verify accuracy of mean stars awarded
    - Examine distribution of stars awarded
    - Determine bias
2. Extract reviews done by USA "home country" reviewers
    - Approximately 26K reviews
3. Analyze the USA "home country" data
    - Mirror analysis of overall population
4. Compare analyses.

Conclusions
========================================================
- Germany results skewed by limited number of "home country" reviews
- There is USA "home country" bias but it is against USA based businesses
    - USA based businesses receive average of 3.72 stars
    - Non-USA based business receive average of 3.90 stars
    - USA based businesses receive 44.6% less "5 star ratings"
    - Significant impact over several million reviews.
- There is less bias in overall population
    - Mean USA stars higher than ratings by "home country" reviewers
    - Mean non-USA stars lower than ratings by "home country" reviewers


Mean Stars Assigned by Home Country
```{r finaltable, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
# Output the table
ttt <- aggregate(review_stars ~ max_country + country, 
                 reviews[reviews$single_country == "FALSE", ], mean)
ttt <- cast(ttt, max_country ~ country, value = "review_stars")
names(ttt)[1] <- c("Home Country")

kable(ttt)
